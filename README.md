# MVCore Website CMS
My first complete cms made for muonline private server years ago (2016-2017), codes are old and there are several things that can be improved in security and in features but will try my best to improve it for anyone who likes this web and anyone who wish to help on this can join and suggest fixes.

Goal is to make it bugless as much as possible and fixing sql inject bugs and other holes, yet keeping the way it works and looks without adding any extra custom features.

## Website Reinstall/Install:
1) Delete sql.php if exists.
2) Enter localhost or domain name in browser
3) Fallow steps and install website.

## Webhost/Localhost Requirements:
* PHP 5.6
* mssql extension
* cURL Extension
